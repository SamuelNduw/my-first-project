## my-first-project E-commerce site

### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, My name is **Samuel Nduw**
#### I am Web developer (Frontend)
Welcome to my ecommerce website repository! This website is designed to showcase my frontend skills and knowledge on SEO. 

[E-Commerce Website](https://samuelnduw.github.io/my-first-project/)

Inspired by top e-commerce websites like Apple and WebEverything, I've created a seamless and user-friendly website. Navigation is easy with a clear information architecture and site-wide menu.

Each page has been carefully designed to increase the chances of a sale, with clear and concise product presentations and suggested ranges in a carousel view below lifestyle shots.

As the field of e-commerce design is always evolving, I constantly test new strategies to improve website navigation, checkout flow, and customer support. I look forward to developing and testing new assumptions and design hypotheses to establish a new "best practice" for e-commerce website design on this site.

**Notice**
Transaction, Cart, Check Out Process and Search functions are not yet present, but will be added soon!
