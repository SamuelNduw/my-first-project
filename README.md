# my-first-project

Welcome to my ecommerce website repository! This website is designed to showcase my frontend skills and knowledge on SEO. 

Although it does not include transactions or a cart function yet, it is built with the best practices of ecommerce website design in mind.

I have taken inspiration from some of the best ecommerce website design examples, such as apple and WebEverything, to create a seamless and intuitive user experience. The website is built to be easy to navigate, with a clear information architecture and site-wide navigation.

I have also paid close attention to individual page layouts, ensuring that each page is designed to optimize the odds of making a sale. The product presentation is clear and concise, with a suggested range in a carousel view below the lifestyle shot.

As an ever-evolving field, I am constantly testing different strategies for improving website navigation, checkout flow, and all-matters customer support. I am excited to continue developing new assumptions and design hypotheses, and testing them on this site to develop a new “best practice” for ecommerce website design.
